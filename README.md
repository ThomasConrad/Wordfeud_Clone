# Wordfeud_Clone
Wordfeud clone to improve the point scoring system. 

I started this project because I felt the way that points were given in wordfeud wasn't fair. I wanted to build a better rating system and a method to provide a handicap when you are playing against a higher ranked player. This is created in javascript using the p5 library. It runs in the browser.
